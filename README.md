# Prime Digital Academy - Code Challenge

## Goals
Create an application that allows users to keep a record of their favorite movies. 
The application will allow them to input information. Once they have finished entering the information, 
they will be able to 'save' their information into an array that is displayed on a different section of the application.


## Base Mode

For this application, you will need two views, two controllers, and one factory:

The first view will be a series of inputs and a button. The inputs should include the movie name, a short description of the movie, the director, and how long the movie is.

The controller for the first view should have a button that 'grabs' the information off of the form and stores it inside of a factory for the second view.

The second view should display all of the movies using a ng-repeat.

The second controller should grab all of the movies from the factory and make them available to the view.

## Hard Mode
Style the whole experience with Bootstrap!

## Pro Mode
Have a break down the middle for the two views. So rather than have the experience stacked top and bottom, have them side by side.
